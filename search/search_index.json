These rings can rotate to indicate a timer countdown, or player/enemy health bars, or even used in chart \n graph demonstrations in a business app. It was designed to be lightweight and flexible, with good performance even on older mobile devices.\n\n\n\n\nAdding the Plugin to your App\n\n\n\n\nActivate the plugin at the Corona Marketplace\n\n\nAdd an entry into the \nplugins\n table of your project's \nbuild.settings\n file. Below is an example of a minimal build.settings file with the required entry for the progressRing plugin:\n\n\n\n\nsettings = {}\n\nsettings.plugins = {\n  ['plugin.progressRing'] = {publisherId = 'com.schroederapps'},\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a Progress Ring\n\n\nTo create a \nprogressRing\n object, first \nrequire\n the plugin into your app/scene:\n\n\nlocal progressRing = require('plugin.progressRing')\n\n\n\n\nNext, call \nprogressRing.new()\n, which will return a progress ring object with the default parameters:\n\n\nlocal myRing = progressRing.new()\n\n\n\n\nNOTE:\n Progress rings are, at their core, just Corona \nGroupObjects\n.
